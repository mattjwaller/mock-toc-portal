# Railway Deployment Status

## 🚨 Current Issue: Healthcheck Failing

**Problem**: Server is not starting properly on Railway, causing healthcheck failures.

**Symptoms**:
- Service unavailable errors
- Healthcheck timeout after 10 minutes
- Server not responding to `/health` endpoint

## 🔧 Applied Fixes

### 1. Enhanced Server Startup
- ✅ Added robust error handling
- ✅ Added database connection testing
- ✅ Added graceful shutdown handlers
- ✅ Fixed TypeScript compilation errors
- ✅ Added better logging

### 2. Simplified Startup Process
- ✅ Removed complex startup script
- ✅ Using simple `npm start` command
- ✅ Added fallback health endpoint
- ✅ Added startup test script

### 3. Railway Configuration
- ✅ Extended healthcheck timeout to 10 minutes
- ✅ Increased restart attempts to 5
- ✅ Using `/health` endpoint (no database required)

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Deploy Current Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix server startup issues"
git push
```

### 2. Check Railway Logs
If you have Railway CLI:
```bash
npm install -g @railway/cli
railway login
railway logs
```

### 3. Verify Environment Variables
Make sure these are set in Railway:
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...  # Auto-set by Railway
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
GOTRUE_SITE_URL=https://your-app-name.up.railway.app
NODE_ENV=production
```

### 4. Test Locally (if possible)
```bash
# Test startup
npm run test:startup

# Build and start
npm run build
npm start
```

## 🔍 Debugging Commands

### Check Railway Status
```bash
railway status
railway logs
railway variables
```

### Manual Database Setup
```bash
railway run npm run migrate
railway run npm run db:seed
```

### Test Health Endpoints
```bash
# Simple health (no database)
curl https://your-app.up.railway.app/health

# Database health
curl https://your-app.up.railway.app/healthz
```

## 📋 Environment Variables Checklist

- [ ] `DATABASE_URL` (Railway auto-sets this)
- [ ] `SUPABASE_URL`
- [ ] `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- [ ] `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET`
- [ ] `GOTRUE_SITE_URL`
- [ ] `NODE_ENV=production`

## 🎯 Expected Outcome

After deploying the current changes:
1. Server should start successfully
2. `/health` endpoint should respond immediately
3. Database connection should work (if env vars are set)
4. Healthcheck should pass within 10 minutes

## 🚨 If Still Failing

1. **Check Railway logs** for specific error messages
2. **Verify all environment variables** are set correctly
3. **Try manual migration**: `railway run npm run migrate`
4. **Check database connection**: `railway run npx prisma db pull`
5. **Review troubleshooting guide**: `DEPLOYMENT_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
